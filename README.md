Hand Motion Cursor revolutionizes human-computer interaction, offering seamless control through intuitive Hand Motions, minimizing direct physical contact with the computer. This innovative project harnesses advanced Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to accurately interpret handmotion and commands without the need for extra hardware. Powered by state-of-the-art models like CNN implemented by MediaPipe and seamlessly integrated using pybind11, it ensures smooth and precise interaction. With two distinct modules, users can choose between direct hand detection via [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) or the option of using gloves of any uniform color, providing flexibility and adaptability to different user preferences and environments. Currently optimized for the Windows platform, Hand Motion Cursor sets a new standard for effortless and immersive computing experiences.


Note: Use Python version: 3.8.5
